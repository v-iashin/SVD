# SVD using gradient descent

*18/09/2016*

This is my attempt to code my own SVD using gradient descent method on Python. 

This code will be submitted as homework at my University.

The 'function'-file in this repository contains the code of a function that was written on Python.

The 'example'-file contains the code of an example.
